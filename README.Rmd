# Lab6

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **Lab6** is to explore how algorithmic design and implementation affect computational performance in R.
We create an R package to study algorithms of different computational complexities and demonstrate ways to make R code faster.

In this lab, we will:

- task 1

- task 2

- task 3...


## Installation

You can install the development version of **Lab6** from GitHub using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# don't already have devtools:
install.packages("devtools")

# install the package:
devtools::install_github("danielwalker/Lab6")
```
