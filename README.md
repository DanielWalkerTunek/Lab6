The goal of **Lab6** is to explore how algorithmic design and
implementation affect computational performance in R. We create an R
package to study algorithms of different computational complexities and
demonstrate ways to make R code faster.


## Installation

You can install the development version of **Lab6** from GitHub using:

``` r
# don't already have devtools:
install.packages("devtools")

# install the package:
devtools::install_github("danielwalker/Lab6")
```

## Package vignette

This package includes a vignette titled **“lab report knapsack”**, which
serves as the **main lab report** for **Lab 6**.  
The vignette contains the written answers, explanations, and performance
comparisons between the three algorithms.

After installing and building the package, you can view the vignette
using:

``` r
browseVignettes("Lab6")
```
